# How it Works
> Nametag Maker uses vanillia Minecraft's teams which are an extension of the scoreboards system to change the display color of users and to apply prefixes and suffixies to names. Using teams also has the unintended but beneifical side effect of changing the tablist colors along with displaying prefixes and suffixes.
